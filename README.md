# Genetic Algorithm

Genetic Algorithms are search and optimisation algorithms that are based on theory of evolution. It is a derivative free, random approach that 
aims that finding the optimal value. Here we are using Genetic Algorithm to find the optimal feature subset to improve classification accuracy.
